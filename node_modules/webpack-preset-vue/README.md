# webpack-preset-vue

An easy way to get started with VueJS and Webpack.

This package allows you to get started using VueJS with Webpack without worrying about missing some dependency needed for your Vue templates. although the list is quite simple, but probably you've missed a dependency or two.

There are already a lot of solutions to this problem, [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) and plethora of Yeoman generators, [like my own](https://github.com/logaretm/generator-webpack-vue) provide boilerplate to get you started quickly with preconfigured files.

However they are heavily opinionated and that is not a bad thing, in many cases they are "best practice" and have many sensible considerations. this package however doesn't care about how you will configure your workflow, it just installs Vue and Webpack workflow node dependencies with a simple install command. which will be suitable for your project regardless of what workflow you are using.

## Install

`npm install webpack-preset-vue`

if you want to use VueJS 2.0 (currently in beta) use this command instead:

`npm install webpack-preset-vue@next`
